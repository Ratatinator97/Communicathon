> This is a MEAN stack web app built for my younger brother that has down syndrom. I wanted him to communicate with pictogramms trough this web app. Unfortunately I was very unexperienced with Angular and Nodejs at the time. I'm planning to start over this whole application and host it on my personnal homeserver. 

## Install
